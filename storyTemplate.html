          <p id='chapterOneStory'>You find yourself wandering through the dense forest. You don't remember how you got here or where you are, but for some reason you feel compelled to follow the sun toward a tall rock formation. You climb atop and spot a wheathered old man on the other side. He is stooping to gather a drink from the glistening blue stream that carves through the forrest. His rags look as old as time and he is clearly struggling to gather the water in his hands. He sees you looking at him and narrows his eyes. "Whitless Boy!" he beckons you. "Would you answer my Riddle?"</p>

You have heard tales in your village of similar visions and you resolve to find out more about it once you return home to your village. You must leave soon to make it before nightfall so you gather up your sword and provisions to head out. The bog that surrounds you is thick and smells of decay and rotting wood. You start to notice a feeling of strangeness in you and a foreboding sense that something is lurking in the shadows. Suddenly, the land from under you starts to shift and bubbles are rising from the thick mud around you. You leap fron the rising mound and spin on your heel. Before you you see an enormous swamp troll rising out of the mud. You hear a muffled groan as it stretches to its full height. "Human?" it grunts. "Solve puzzle or lunchtime."</p>
